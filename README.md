# Gold Price Prediction
Gold Price Prediction is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for predicting gold prices using a polynomial regression model. The application is built using Python's Tkinter library and leverages scikit-learn for machine learning.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: The application provides a user-friendly interface to input the year and display the predicted gold price.
- **Polynomial Regression Model**: The prediction model is trained using polynomial regression to capture the non-linear trend of gold prices over the years.
- **Background and Icon Customization**: The application features a custom background image and icon.

## Dependencies

- `tkinter` for the GUI
- `joblib` for loading the pre-trained model
- `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation
- `scikit-learn` for the polynomial regression model

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script to run the application.
- `icon.png`: The icon for the application window.
- `Background.png`: The background image for the application.
- `Gold rate.csv`: The dataset containing historical gold prices.
- `Gold_Price_Model.pkl`: The pre-trained polynomial regression model.
